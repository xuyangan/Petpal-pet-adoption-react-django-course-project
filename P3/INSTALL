To run locally:
Navigate one terminal into '/backend' and run source venv/bin/activate to activate virtual environment
Navigate into '/backend/petpal' and run python3 manage.py makemigrations
Also run python3 manage.py migrate
Now use the command python3 manage.py runserver to get a local version of the backend running

From the P3 folder, navigate into '/frontend'
Run npm start to start the frontend
(If running into errors such as a syntax error, check if npm is the latest version)

To deploy:
In backend
Run pip install gunicorn
Navigate to '/backend/petpal' and run gunicorn petpal.wsgi

Run sudo apt-get install nginx
Use the command npm run build to create a build folder
Run sudo mkdir /var/www/html/react
Run sudo cp -R /path/to/build /var/www/html/react/

  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  root /var/www/html/react/build;
  location / {
    try_files $uri /index.html;  
  }
